      As a new user, you can get started with Bitcoin without understanding the
      technical details. Once you've installed a Bitcoin wallet on your computer
      or mobile phone, it will generate your first Bitcoin address and you can
      create more whenever you need one. You can disclose your addresses to your
      friends so that they can pay you or vice versa. In fact, this is pretty
      similar to how email works, except that Bitcoin addresses should be used
      only once.
